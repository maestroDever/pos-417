In "components/CurrentOrders" - Edit Order button should open the order in 'views/Menu:orderID' using db to fetch order details.  *Important* 'views/Menu:orderID' must have have all order items and modifications prefilled when loaded (example: If the order had a Tombstone modified with no tomato via dropdown menu, when the order is pulled up, the 'no tomato' dropdown must default to 'no tomato').  Might need to use localstorage or cookies for this.

In "" - On submit, move document from 'buildingOrder' to 'currentOrders'

In "views/CustomerManagement" - Make 'more_horiz' icon pop up a dialog box that will contain "views/CustomerProfile?customer_id=1554787251513" (or "components/CustomerInfo?customer_id=1554787251513").  The dialog box will display the customers data from Firebase with the ability to edit.

"components/CustomerInfo" (in "views/CustomerProfile")

In "views/ThisWeeksSchedule" / Components: "ScheduleRequests1" and "CheckScheduleRequests" and "CheckScheduleRequests1" - Have the ability to move a document from db collection 'scheduleRequests' to db collection 'oldScheduleRequests', and the other way around.

In "components/CustomerInfo" (in "views/CustomerProfile") - Render customer info from database db collection 'customers' based on customer ID number (this information cannot be edited, only can be edited by using the 'edit customer' button).  Make 'Edit Customer' button pop up a dialog box that gives the ability to edit and save the db document based on the customer ID. 

In "views/Phone" - Customer Profile button should go to 'views/CustomerProfile?customer_id=1554787251513'.  Example: When 'customer profile' is clicked, it will go to the 'views/customerprofile?customerID_XXXXXXXXXX' page and render the customers information into the fields using the customer number to get the customers info.

In "views/Phone" and "components/CustomerInfo" - 'Pickup' icon button routes to to 'views/pickupMenu?customer_id=XXXXXXXXXXXXX/order_id=1554787251513'.  Example: When 'pickup' is clicked, it will create and start a new order in db collection 'buildingOrders' with a new orderID number with the customerID number attached.  When the order is submitted, it will have the customers ID attached so that if you have to look up the order later, you know what customer it was. Or, if you look up the customer, you will want to know what orders they have made.

In "views/Phone" and "components/CustomerInfo" - 'Delivery' icon button routes to to 'views/deliveryMenu?order_id=XXXXXXXXXXXXX/order_id=1554787251513.  Example: When 'delivery' is clicked, it will create and start a new order in db collection 'buildingOrders' with a new orderID number with the customerID number attached.  When the order is submitted, it will have the customers ID attached so that if you have to look up the order later, you know what customer it was. Or, if you look up the customer, you will want to know what orders they have made.

In "views/StoreDashboard" - Remove large gap and make third and fourth components the same size as the top two components.

In "views/StoreDashboard" - Fix text rendering issue.  Text is not rending until I hit the 'edit' button.

In "views/MainMenu" - Render information from "views/StoreDashboard" (Firebase) using the same format that it is currently in hardcoded.

In "views/Phone" - Make dashes automatically appear when typing in numbers so that the phone number format looks like this '555-555-5555' even without actually keying in the dashes.

In "views/Phone" - Add an (X) icon button on left that clears the search field.

In "views/Phone" - Make dialog pop up title be 'Add New Customer' when button is clicked, and 'Customer Info' 

In "components/CurrentEmployees" - Make 'arrow_downward' button fire two actions when pressed (after confirmation). Action 1 is to copy/save/move the employee information document into the db collection called 'pastEmployees'.  Action 2 would be to delete the employee document from collection 'employees'

In "components/PastEmployees" - Make 'arrow_upward' button fire two actions when pressed (after confirmation). Action 1 is to copy/save/move the employee information document into the db collection called 'employees'.  Action 2 would be to delete the document from db collection 'pastEmployees'

Have 'Submit Dates' button send both date-picker dates to db collection: 'scheduleDates' - document: 'thisWeeksSchedule' - fields: 'date1 and date2'.  Must write over this document everytime dates are submitted.

In "views/NextWeeksSchedule" - Fix date picker so that it operates independently from other date picker.  Have 'Submit Dates' button send both date-picker dates to db collection: 'scheduleDates' - document: 'nextWeeksSchedule' - fields: 'date1 and date2'.  Must write over this document everytime dates are submitted.

In "views/Phone - When a user is typing in the phone number, if no match found, the user will click 'Add New Customer'.  The phone number that was typed into the search field should show in 'phone number' field of pop up dialog box.

In 'views/Inshop' - Currently I have the button set to create a new document inside the buildingOrder collection with a newly created orderID inside the document (you can make that part better if needed).  Now, I need that button to also push/route to 'views/Menu/orderID' where orderID is the newly created ID number. Everytime an order starts, it should get a specific orderID number.

In EmployeeMangement.vue file
    `PastEmployees` and `CurrentEmployees` components have @upward/@downward event - that 
        fires corresponding methods of the parent component
    When `upward & downward` methods fire, they call child component's method by using
        this.$refs.past.selectItem ...

In CurrentEmployees.vue & PastEmployees.vue >>
    a new parameter `source` is added to methods:
        save() & deleteItem()
          This is the indicator telling who is calling the method
          so when a parent calls, certain notificaiton is shown
